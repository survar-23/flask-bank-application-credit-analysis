Bank Loan Eligibility Prediction

Overview

This project is a Bank Loan Eligibility Prediction Application designed to assist financial institutions in evaluating a customer's eligibility for a loan.
By analyzing key details such as employment tenure, income, income-to-credit ratio, credit-to-debit ratio, and other financial obligations, the application leverages machine learning models to predict whether it is advisable to approve a loan.

Features

Analyze customer financial and employment data, including:
- Employment tenure.
- Income levels.
- Financial ratios (e.g., income-to-credit, credit-to-debit).
- Other debts or obligations.
- Train and evaluate a machine learning classification model for predictive analysis.
- Provide a simple and interpretable outcome: Loan Approved or Loan Denied.

Full data science workflow implemented:
- Data preprocessing.
- Feature engineering.
- Model training and evaluation.

Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries and Tools:
- Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
- Scikit-learn for machine learning modeling.
- Version Control: Git and GitHub

Steps Followed
